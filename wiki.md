# Chapter 132: Liu Changdie

[43] The man quickly stood up and cupped his hands to greet them, "I am Liu Changdie, a pleasure to meet you both!"

[49] Liu Changdie hurriedly cupped his hands and explained, "I once had the honor of visiting Azure Pond Sect at a friend's invitation, where I met the Qingsui Sword Immortal. We had a delightful exchange, and I was moved by his celestial demeanor. I saw the Qingche Sword... its green and white remarkable beauty is unforgettable to this day in my mind!"

[57] Liu Changdie paused, nodding politely with an air of elegance and bringing the conversation to a close, though he was inwardly surprised.

[63] His thoughts raced like lightning but he maintained his composure, continuing to chat warmly with the two. Liu Changdie shared his experiences within the Azure Pond Sect, touching on Li Chejing. Both listeners were so engrossed that they failed to scrutinize his expressions closely.

[65] "Whenever the Qingsui Sword Immortal faces an enemy, he invariably starts with a sword draw that resembles a crescent moon or a large white sail... or flicker like a star. Its power is most astonishing, often severely injuring the opponent with a single strike!" Liu Changdie continued nervously, relieved to see the others nodding, much to his own relief.

[79] Liu Changdie nodded, having over a hundred years of experience in setting up formations in his previous and present lives. This grand formation was not exactly a piece of cake for him, but he was indeed well-practiced.

[83] Liu Changdie lifted his head proudly, his obsession with formation techniques in his previous life led him to study them painstakingly, even at the expense of his own cultivation.

[85] Now, his mastery over formation techniques was unmatched on the Guli Road, to the extent that even a few genius formation masters from the three sects and seven schools could hardly compare to his level of expertise. Liu Changdie believed that even Wan Huaqian, if he were to rise from the grave, might not necessarily be his match.

[91] "It’s just... I wonder how many Spirit Stones it would require..?" Li Xuanfeng did not agree hastily but first asked Liu Changdie for a specific price, his voice trailing off slightly.

[93] "Qingsui Sword Immortal and I are good friends; he has been of great help in my cultivation, for which I am deeply grateful." Liu Changdie nodded sincerely and continued, "I felt an instant connection with Brother Xuanfeng, so I'll speak frankly. I've simulated the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation many times, and to cover these two peaks, the cost should be around eighty to ninety Spirit Stones... with the usual fee starting at one hundred and twenty Spirit Stones."

# Chapter 133: Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman

[7] Hesitating to speak out due to his financial constraints, he saw Liu Changdie smiling in amusement.

[13] Li Xuanfeng's face lit up with both surprise and skepticism, observing Liu Changdie's confident demeanor.

[17] It seems my fourth uncle is indeed highly sought after in the sect... First, the Moon Lake Peak disciple personally disembarks to befriend me, and now Liu Changdie eagerly pleases our family...

[21] Acknowledging Liu Changdie's intentions, he spoke with a smile. "The Li family will remember this kindness! Once this is completed, should you visit Moongaze Lake, you are welcome to stay with my Li family and let us extend our hospitality."

[24] Liu Changdie was waiting for just such a response, visibly delighted. He nodded eagerly and promised grandly, "Of course! Should your family have any future needs for formations, feel free to seek me out! There won't be prices lower than mine in the entire Lixia Prefecture."

[30] With that, Liu Changdie cupped his hands and flew off with the wind, leaving the two to enjoy their drinks on the peak in newfound silence.

[34] "Indeed... I've been wondering too." Li Xuanfeng replied with a nod. "The elders in my family are not ones to gossip; it stands to reason that my fourth uncle would not spread such matters. Although Liu Changdie's formation skills are impressive, his mannerisms and speech suggest he's an average person; but since I was born after my fourth uncle had returned to the sect, I'm not too familiar with the intricacies, making it hard to discern such matters."

[42] After some more conversation and the sky gradually darkened, Liu Changdie finally returned.

[54] Upon landing, Liu Changdie looked around curiously, his expression one of sheer excitement. He could not help but ponder to himself.

[62] "No need for formalities... Liu Changdie of Lixia Prefecture, greetings!"

[64] Liu Changdie cupped his fist and scrutinized the man before him, finding him somewhat reminiscent of Li Yuanjiao from his memories.

[66] "This is Liu Changdie from the prefecture, a renowned formation master here to set up a formation for us," Li Xuanfeng explained.

[76] Just as Liu Changdie arrived at the back mountain, Lu Jiangxian uttered a light exclamation, putting down the unformed mass of Supreme Yin Moonlight in his hands.

[78] Dissipating his physical form, he transformed his divine sense from within the mirror into something formless and intangible, swirling around Liu Changdie.

[80] "There's... a scent of talisman qi." Lu Jiangxian articulated. With a sweep of his divine sense, Liu Changdie's six chakras and three orifices were laid bare as though unguarded. It transformed from the Profound Scenery Chakra to the Nascent Spirit Chakra, all minutely detailed yet without any anomalies.

[84] Lu Jiangxian frowned slightly and pointed sharply at Liu Changdie, his divine sense immediately flooding into his Shenyang Mansion—the main soul hub in the body. A series of fleeting images flashed before his eyes, and a phantom silver shadow emerged.

[90] This Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman was not within Liu Changdie's body but indicated that Liu Changdie had likely come into contact with the Profound Talisman, having been influenced by it. Lu Jiangxian mobilized the remnant talisman qi within him, and a series of images promptly appeared before his eyes.

[92] Included were scenes of people weeping, calamities and locust plagues, the annihilation of immortal clans, and the ravages of demonic disasters... Everything seemed logical, as though Liu Changdie himself had truly experienced these events only to awaken from a grand dream, returning to his twenties or thirties.

[94] "This Profound Talisman has fabricated over seventy years of memories for him, all derived from current events by the Profound Talisman and not because Liu Changdie traveled back in time! If it involved the power of time, it's doubtful that the talisman qi could achieve such a feat!"

[98] Lu Jiangxian gathered this lingering energy gently in his hand, leaving only a trace of fleeting images in Liu Changdie's Shenyang Mansion.

[102] Although Lu Jiangxian possessed a powerful divine sense, he lacked the skill to modify someone else's memories. Without the residual talisman qi in the Shenyang Mansion, he couldn't even access another's memories, much less interfere with Liu Changdie.

[108] As Lu Jiangxian's divine sense withdrew, Liu Changdie felt a chill on his back as if a cold breeze had brushed against him. His hand trembled slightly with the tea bowl, but he was unable to pinpoint the anomaly.

[110] Beside him, Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng suddenly stood up respectfully, bowing their heads. Liu Changdie looked up to see a middle-aged man approaching from outside the courtyard.

[114] Liu Changdie quickly stood up, cupping his hands respectfully. "Greetings from Liu Changdie of Lixia Prefecture, Senior!"

[120] Li Tongya took his seat while Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng followed suit, maintaining a proper posture without slackening. Liu Changdie, having encountered a renowned figure from his memories, was both excited and reserved.

[122] Li Tongya observed Liu Changdie for a moment, noting his Qi Cultivation Realm was at the second heavenly layer. He appeared to be in his late twenties or early thirties, with an old-school demeanor, judging by how he called him "senior" right away.

# Chapter 134: Formation and Engagement

[5] Liu Changdie, still harboring a bit of restraint and excitement, quickly reiterated what he had discussed with Li Xuanfeng on Cloud Crowned Peak. He knew that Li Chejing was Li Tongya's younger brother.

[21] After hearing Liu Changdie's plan, he nodded and instructed, "Master Liu, please proceed as you see fit... The Li Family will fully cooperate. Xuanxuan, you and Master Liu will take charge of the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation."

[33] Over a thousand craftsmen ascended the mountain, with villagers transporting timber and stone materials, spending several days under Liu Changdie's direction to begin the construction of high platforms at the designated formation eyes.

[39] Liu Changdie would need to stay with the Li Family for more than half a year, as determining the formation's positions and inscribing the formation patterns couldn't proceed without him.

[41] Li Xuanxuan found a small courtyard at the foot of the mountain for Liu Changdie, which facilitated their daily interactions. Liu Changdie, living up to his expectations, walked the mountains daily, personally overseeing the work. This proved his serious dedication and that he truly took the matter to heart.

# Chapter 136: Sun Rite Profound Light Formation

[5] Liu Changdie breathed a sigh of relief and went to find Li Xuanxuan for the formation flags.

[9] Liu Changdie had already discussed this matter with Li Xuanxuan early on, but he kept them hidden and delayed revealing them.

[11] As soon as he entered the courtyard, Liu Changdie saw Li Xuanxuan wearing a simple leather outfit. He was drawing symbols on a large pear wood table using cloth as a base and diluted ink, giving it a very light appearance.

[13] Liu Changdie was curious but figured that it was probably someone else's cultivation secret and dared not pry.

[17] "Brother Xuanxuan!" Liu Changdie called out and saw Li Xuanxuan nod slightly and smile at him. Liu Changdie found this rather odd.

[19] In his previous life, Liu Changdie did not meet Li Xuanxuan or anyone from the Xuan generation in the Li family. His understanding of Li Xuanxuan was limited to what Li Yuanjiao mentioned, who used to dismissively say, "My old man... He’s boring! There’s nothing interesting about him!"

[21] Liu Changdie just laughed, not daring to respond. After spending over a year with Li Xuanxuan, he had come to his own conclusion.

[25] Noticing the boy beside the table, Liu Changdie smiled slightly and his curiosity got the better of him.

[31] Liu Changdie nodded as if he had just realized something. After a few moments of contemplation, he moved on to the main topic and reported, "I've finished engraving the formation patterns on the eight platforms... We can start setting up the formation now."

[36] Before he could speak, Liu Changdie, fixated on the flags, exclaimed, "White Feather Purple Flags!"

[38] Li Xuanxuan was taken aback, knowing the flags were precious but not expecting such a reaction from Liu Changdie. Seeing his intense interest, he nodded in confirmation.

[42] Liu Changdie eagerly took them, examining them with great appreciation and fascination.

[50] "So, it never left Mount Huaqian... That news was a decoy!" Liu Changdie realized, showing a trace of regret, and continued, "I’ve only seen Mount Huaqian from a distance. Wan Huaqian's ability to set up a formation that could withstand a peak Qi Cultivator’s attack with such a small and flawed mountain proves his superior formation talents!"

[56] Liu Changdie shook his head and sighed.

[60] After finishing the conversation, Liu Changdie, with a smile, offered a suggestion to Li Xuanxuan.

[70] Liu Changdie sat cross-legged, adjusting his breath for a period equivalent to the time taken for an incense stick to burn.

[74] "Mission accomplished!" Liu Changdie exhaled deeply and nodded slightly.

[96] Liu Changdie laughed heartily then respectfully bid farewell to Li Tongya. He then departed from the Li Family, heading toward Lixia Prefecture. Li Xuanxuan escorted him to the edge of Li Family’s territory before returning home.

# Chapter 146: River Crossing Torrential Step

[71] "Brother Changdie!" Li Xuanfeng greeted Liu Changdie in a cheery manner.

[79] Liu Changdie was the first to strike a conversation between the two.

[86] After ordering a few dishes and bringing up the wine, Liu Changdie pondered for a moment, then thought to himself, It's been over a decade since that demonic disaster... I wonder if this fellow in front of me has any news about it. However, considering the fact that the calamity affected the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate, Li Xuanfeng might not be aware.

[88] Filtering his thoughts, Liu Changdie came to his own conclusion.

[100] "Haha, just asking!" Liu Changdie replied as he quickly changed the subject, feeling somewhat helpless inside. He had hoped to achieve great things in this life, but aside from cultivating faster and bringing back his knowledge of array formations, he found almost nothing else useful.

[102] The powerful figures from his past life had not yet risen, and they never publicly shared their rise to power, leaving Liu Changdie at a loss on how to seize an advantage beforehand. He only remembered some major events from his past life, barely managing to establish some relationships with potential figures.

[112] With this statement, an unrestrained and unruly aura enveloped him. Liu Changdie replied with an incredulous look, "Brother Xuanfeng, your words are almost demonic, resembling the chaos sown by the demonic faction..."

[118] "Brother Xuanfeng is really..." Liu Changdie chuckled wryly, finding Li Xuanfeng's carefree demeanor somewhat relaxing.

[122] "However, Brother Xuanfeng... we shouldn't speak too plainly in public," Liu Changdie cautioned after scanning their surroundings.

# Chapter 147: Seclusion

[3] Li Xuanfeng bid farewell to Liu Changdie and left some money behind for Jiang Yunu, then rode the wind southward along the Guli Road for a few hours. The faint golden light dome enveloped in misty clouds of Mount Lijing appeared before him.

# Chapter 166: The Bestowal of Talismans to the Generation of Yuan and Qing

[41] "Li Yuanxiu was indeed a good choice, but based on the future deduced from the Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman for Liu Changdie, there's no sign of Li Yuanxiu in the Li Family's future... Investing comes with risks and requires caution!"

# Chapter 208: Enmity

[168] "It was set up by Master Liu Changdie," Li Tongya replied, causing Xiao Yuansi to raise his eyebrow at the mention of the name.

[170] "I've seen this Liu Changdie before," Xiao Yuansi chimed in warmly, "He's quite an interesting person... Very skillful in formations and speaks as if he's been around for nearly a century. He seems to know many people."

# Chapter 273: Matters Concluded

[43] He waved his hand and gestured to Li Xuanfeng below, speaking warmly. "Xuanfeng, go to Lixia Prefecture and invite Liu Changdie over to examine the earth vein and terrain of Mount Huaqian. Have him prepare the formation."

# Chapter 278: Reunion With An Old Friend

[37] Liu Changdie soared leisurely through the air, his eyes fixed on the golden glow of the longbow on Li Xuanfeng's back. While offering his congratulations, his eyes lit up as he thought to himself, That bow must be the Golden Age! In my previous life, I only saw its golden aura during a demonic attack while reinforcing the Azure Pond Sect's formation... Now, I can finally see it up close!

[41] Liu Changdie observed Li Xuanfeng's aura, noticing that he had reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Envy filled his heart as he congratulated Li Xuanfeng, saying, "Brother Xuanfeng, you are not even thirty-five yet you've already reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. You might be able to attempt the Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough by the time you are forty or fifty!"

[45] The two exchanged compliments as Mount Huaqian came into view below. Li Xuanfeng led Liu Changdie into the courtyard, where they were greeted by a nimble-footed youth in black robes who cupped his fist respectfully.

[53] Liu Changdie immediately recognized him and swallowed back the Brother Jiao that almost slipped past his lips, finding the situation rather awkward. Li Xuanfeng quickly introduced them.

[57] Seeing the young man before him, Liu Changdie felt strange. Nevertheless, he was

[61] Li Xuanfeng gave him a strange look. While he considered Liu Changdie a peer, Liu Changdie wanted to treat Li Yuanjiao as an equal, which would naturally disrupt the generational hierarchy.

[65] Unable to refuse, Liu Changdie finally said, "It's fine when Brother Xuanfeng is present. Privately, Yuanjiao and I can address each other as equals."

[67] Li Xuanfeng nodded, transmitting a message to Li Yuanjiao using his mana, "Liu Changdie is a good-natured person and an expert in formations. Though he can be eccentric, he is harmless... Just let him be."

[71] Liu Changdie nodded and replied, "Years ago, when I set up the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation on Mount Lijing, I also observed Mount Huaqian's spirit veins. The mountain lacks several key points and is relatively low and narrow... Even the legendary Wan Huaqian could only set up a formation to withstand a peak Qi Cultivator here."

[77] Liu Changdie saw Li Xuanfeng's approval and nodded. "If your esteemed family lacks spare formation flags, we will need to use a formation plate. With Wan Huaqian's legacy as a reference, I can set up the formation for about fifty to sixty Spirit Stones."

# Chapter 279: Guest Elder

[3] Liu Changdie simply waved his hand and laughed.

[7] Li Xuanfeng quickly realized what Liu Changdie meant, and nodded as he replied, "Brother Changdie, feel free to speak. If it is within our family's capability, we will certainly not refuse!"

[9] Liu Changdie paused to organize his thoughts before speaking softly.

[13] Liu Changdie knew the Li Family possessed a perception technique called Spirit Eye Perception. He had long coveted it in his previous life but had never managed to obtain it. Since he had a good relationship with the Li Family now, he thought it was the right time to request it.

[17] Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, causing Liu Changdie to feel a bit uneasy. Li Xuanfeng put down his tea bowl and thought silently, Could this be a coincidence? Liu Changdie is strange but has shown kindness toward our family. Not knowing his background, we did not dare invite him to join our family as a guest elder when we only had a few Qi Cultivators. I even recently discussed this with Brother Xuan... Maybe we should take this opportunity...

[21] "It was presumptuous of me!" Liu Changdie immediately exclaimed, lowering his head in disappointment as he apologized.

[25] "Are you serious?" Liu Changdie asked eagerly, clearly overjoyed. He had consistently demonstrated goodwill toward the Li family, yet had refrained from requesting to become a guest cultivator, fearing that his excessive enthusiasm might be misinterpreted as having ulterior motives.

[29] Elated by the good news, Liu Changdie felt revitalized. In his previous life, he had never been a significant figure and spent most of his life humbly trying to make breakthroughs, often being scolded and ordered around.

[35] "The formation plate is not effective just anywhere. If I am not mistaken, the formation plate on Mount Yuting was specifically arranged to match the spirit veins there. Therefore, simply moving it to Mount Huazhong would naturally reduce its power!" Liu Changdie replied matter-of-factly.

[41] Liu Changdie and Li Yuanjiao both acknowledged their tasks. After Li Xuanfeng left, Li Yuanjiao turned to Liu Changdie and asked, "Senior, what kind of spirit materials and how much labor will you need? I will start preparing right away."

[43] Liu Changdie's mouth twitched with embarrassment as he awkwardly said, "Please, don't call me that... I'll write down the requirements later so you make the necessary preparations, Brother Yuanjiao!"

# Chapter 280: Changes in the North

[41] There were two knocks at the door, and Li Xuanfeng entered quickly with a golden bow strapped onto his back. He cupped his fist and said, "Second Uncle, Liu Changdie has arrived at Mount Huaqian to set up the formation. It will cost fifty-eight Spirit Stones."

[43] Seeing the confusion on Li Tongya's face, Li Xuanfeng continued, "I have also discussed this with Brother Xuan earlier. Liu Changdie is highly skilled in formation techniques, and it would be best if we could have him join the family. I previously tested the waters, and Liu Changdie wishes to become our family's guest elder in exchange for a perception technique as payment for setting up the formation."

[45] Li Tongya pressed his hand against the table, contemplating for a moment. He was slightly hesitant, but he could not blame the younger generation for making their own decisions. He gave them an out, saying, "Liu Changdie has many secrets... It is hard to tell if that is good or bad. However, his skill in formations is indeed impressive. We still need him to set up the grand formation."

[49] Li Tongya, being cautious by nature, was reluctant to take such a risk. He hesitated and then revealed some confidential information, shaking his head, "It is fine. As long as he takes the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath not to disclose it, we can lend him our perception technique. As for making him a guest elder... I have discussed this man with Xiao Yongling. According to him, Liu Changdie seems to have divination abilities, often predicting opportunities and gaining advantages. He seems to know a lot about various fortunes, which makes him... quite unusual.

[51] "This man is so mysterious that even Ancestor Chuting keeps an eye on him. Although Liu Changdie believes his actions are discreet, he was quite conspicuous even when he was just a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. His exceptional talent in formations and his frequent travels made him stand out. There's no way he can escape the eyes of someone as astute as Xiao Chuting. On top of that, Liu Changdie is also involved in many strange occurrences and might bring trouble... It is not the right time to bring him into the family."

[53] Hearing that Liu Changdie was so dangerous and had even caught the attention of the Xiao Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the two younger men felt a pang of regret. Li Xuanxuan was taken aback while Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow.

[61] Li Xuanfeng, not as experienced in managing family affairs as Li Xuanxuan, had forged a friendship with Liu Changdie and felt awkward about directly refusing him.

[79] Liu Changdie, directing a group of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to carve the formation diagram, appeared quite pleased with himself. He was thrilled by the prospect of soon acquiring the Spirit Eye Perception, a skill that could significantly elevate his formation abilities.

# Chapter 281: Guiluan

[3] Liu Changdie was feeling quite pleased with himself as the grand formation was nearly complete. He could already sense the subtle connections of spiritual energy forming within the formation and thought to himself, This formation is almost ready. With the help of the Li Family, once I master the Spirit Eye Perception, I can head north. The Xu State is in chaos right now, and going there might provide me with some opportunities.

[7] Liu Changdie was overjoyed and expressed his thanks repeatedly. He stepped forward, but noticed that Li Xuanfeng looked somewhat regretful as he continued explaining, "Unfortunately, the ancestor is in seclusion, and I could not find him. We have never had a guest elder in the family before, so I cannot make that decision without consulting him first."

[11] Liu Changdie understood that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators often secluded themselves for years, but he could not understand why Li Xuanfeng still brought the Spirit Eye Perception to him.

[17] "How could I possibly accept this?!" Liu Changdie exclaimed, feeling both touched and uneasy.

[23] Li Xuanfeng's words were firm, and he had, after all, handed over the jade slip forcefully. Liu Changdie, naturally cautious, instinctively wanted to withdraw but found that Li Xuanfeng's grip was like an iron vise. He could not pull away until Li Xuanfeng finally released his hand.

[25] Liu Changdie was greatly shocked by his strength, thinking to himself, I used my mana unconsciously, yet I couldn't break free. It is no wonder that in my previous life, everyone in the city feared Li Xuanfeng. His strength is truly terrifying! In my previous life, Li Yuanjiao once said, 'Li Xuanfeng likes to kill demons with arrows. One demon general thought he couldn't fight in close combat and switched to attack him at close range, but Li Xuanfeng had merely laughed and grabbed it with his bare hands, killing it with two strikes!' I guess Li Yuanjiao wasn't exaggerating!

[27] Li Xuanfeng noticed Liu Changdie's fear and quickly apologized, though there was a grin on his face.

[31] Li Xuanfeng's extraordinary strength was due to talisman qi, but of course, he was not going to say that to Liu Changdie. Seeing Liu Changdie repeatedly say "It is fine," Li Xuanfeng added, "Once you have taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, you can start practicing."

[33] "Of course... Thank you," Liu Changdie said gratefully.

[35] After Liu Changdie had taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, Li Xuanfeng handed over the jade slip and continued, "This perception technique is difficult to master. No one in our family has succeeded in practicing it so far, so please do read the content carefully."

[37] Liu Changdie, full of joy, accepted the jade slip eagerly.

[41] Li Xuanfeng had also practiced this perception technique. Lacking a crucial heavenly material called Pure Essence Spirit Water made it exceedingly difficult to master. Seeing Liu Changdie's confident demeanor, his thoughts stirred, thinking to himself, The ancestor said that this man is shrouded in mystery and harbors many secrets... Perhaps he also knows the source of the Pure Essence Spirit Water. I must remain vigilant!

[45] "Of course! Of course!" Liu Changdie agreed readily. Li Xuanfeng wasn't sure if he had thoroughly examined the content but could only cup his fist in return and left on the wind.

[49] Within a month, the grand formation on Mount Huaqian was completed. Liu Changdie managed to restore seventy percent of the original power of the Earth-Locked Huaqian Formation set up by Wan Huaqian. It was more than enough to fend off late-stage Qi Cultivators. It also drew power from the spirit spring within the Mount Huaqian cave dwelling which circulated endlessly. This made it particularly effective against groups of low-level Qi Cultivators and could even hold off a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for the duration it took to burn a stick of incense. Li Xuanfeng was very pleased with this.

[51] With this matter settled, Liu Changdie eagerly went to Mount Huazhong to modify the formation plate. Li Yuanjiao saw off the formation master with mixed feelings of both amusement and relief.

# Chapter 283: The Wolf Demon

[27] Just as Li Xuanxuan was lost in his thoughts, Li Xiewen hurried up to him, interrupting his mind. "Master Liu Changdie has already repaired the formation. He bade farewell to the Second Master and has left northward on the wind," he reported respectfully.

# Chapter 287: Slaying Demons and Receiving Talismans

[156] Lu Jiangxian, now far more skilled, had mastered many techniques in shamanic spell and talisman arts. He had used most of the power of deduction taken from Liu Changdie, and now drew another strand, using the remaining cloud as a propellant. Closing his eyes, he deduced for a moment and received only one word before him.

# Chapter 321: Struggle

[75] Lu Jiangxian activated the power of deduction he had obtained from Liu Changdie. The silver light shrank by a third and then formed a single word—Auspicious.

# Chapter 352: Arrival of the Cloudliner

[7] Liu Changdie sank into the wooden chair as his gaze lingered on the majestic city below, feeling emotions stirring within him. He thought to himself, In my previous life, I came to this place as an insignificant Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer... In this life, I have already reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

[9] Looking at the ancient city before his eyes, the image of a golden longbow appeared in Liu Changdie's mind, causing him to frown as he was filled with deep confusion.

[13] Liu Changdie was originally an ordinary cultivator, but with these memories, he had been living his life smoothly. Now, everything had become unrecognizable, causing him to feel a fearful chill down his spine.

[21] Seeing the advantages of his rebirth gradually fading, Liu Changdie began to lose hope.

[27] Liu Changdie quickly stood up as they descended upon the city below. He saw a majestic great wall stretching out and covered in intricate runes, forming a unified whole and turning the entire city itself into a grand formation.

[31] Liu Changdie had lost count of the times he had climbed up and down these city walls in his previous life, but he was still filled with emotion. Looking up, he saw eagles and sparrows circling relentlessly above the land with bones scattered everywhere. In the distance, a dense forest raised waves of leaves in the north wind.

[35] Following his memories, Liu Changdie landed at this first stronghold of the Yue State, and he saw the cultivators around the stronghold gathering. He searched carefully and finally saw a middle-aged man carrying a golden bow, who was smiling at him.

[39] Liu Changdie ignored the others surrounding him and eagerly went over, saying joyfully, "Congratulations!"

[43] "Hahahaha," Liu Changdie laughed heartily and said, "Senior Tongya has slain the Maha with his sword and forced the retreat of a prestigious clan... His reputation is resounding!"

[51] "No..." Liu Changdie replied softly as he gathered everyone to sit down and began to explain in detail. The group listened, occasionally gasping and sighing.

[55] Liu Changdie smiled wryly, having anticipated his reaction.

[59] Seeing Fei Yihe's incredulous expression, Liu Changdie thought to himself, Losing just Fei Wangbai is far better than the entire clan being wiped out!

# Chapter 365: Azure Manifestation

[185] Seeing Xiao Yuansi's silent and thoughtful appearance, Xiao Chuting shook his head and sighed. "It is a pity that idiot Liu Changdie ran from east to west, then from west to south, desperately trying to traverse the entire Yue State, mixing up all the fates, making it impossible to deduce anything accurately. By now, there are already more than a dozen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan who want to kill him with a single slap. They complain in the east, curse in the west, all barely able to restrain their anger."

[187] Xiao Chuting chuckled as if recalling something amusing, leaving Xiao Yuansi confused. He only heard the name Liu Changdie but did not understand what everything else meant.

# Chapter 369: Wang Xun

[159] Liu Changdie had left eight high platforms when he established the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, which could be used to reinforce the barrier. With eight people present, they could fully activate the formation, making it difficult even for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to break through it.

# Chapter 374: Eradicating the Pest

[141] Liu Changdie had already gone down to maintain the grand formation. Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow while Fei Yihe stood silently beside him, watching the approaching beast horde.

# Chapter 431: Stripped of Clothes and Crown

[159] Considering the timing, Yuanjiao is likely about to establish his foundation. If only I could get Liu Changdie to bring it out with him...

# Chapter 458: Return For A Visit

[3] Liu Changdie soared through the skies toward Mount Dali, fully propelled by the wind. However, a beam of light from the south intercepted his path before it could reach Mount Qingdu, forcing him to come to a sudden halt.

[5] An Zheyan, who had been patrolling for some time, stopped Liu Changdie by the lake. "Who goes there?" he called out.

[9] The man in question had an unassuming appearance but was at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite his youthful appearance, looking no older than thirty, his clothes were of fine quality. He cupped his fist, channeling his mana, and replied respectfully, "Liu Changdie has come to visit. Please..."

[15] Liu Changdie turned to see a striking figure—a heroic face with a pair of bright almond eyes, clad in jade armor and wielding a silver spear. He was momentarily stunned, then quickly cupped his fist again.

[26] Liu Changdie followed her into the mountain. In the hall, two figures awaited—one old and frail, the other middle-aged but pale.

[28] Li Yuanping was discussing clan affairs with his father, Li Xuanxuan, and greeted Liu Changdie warmly.

[30] Liu Changdie responded with a respectful nod, his face lighting up as he thought, It's a relief to see both Li Qinghong and Li Yuanping still alive. At least Yuanjiao won't be alone on Mount Wutu... drinking by himself all the time as he did in my previous life!

[34] Liu Changdie sighed deeply and replied, "It's a dismal place. Soon, more rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea will be able to enter... Striving for it is merely laboring to the benefit of the three sects and seven gates!"

[36] Liu Changdie, having lived two lives now, had only seen the true nature of the three sects and seven gates just before his death in his previous life.

[44] Liu Changdie, lacking specific information, relied on his memories from his previous life and replied gravely, "The Dongli Dao Collection had been taken by Chu Yi. There is nothing particularly good or bad about it, just that the Grade Two and Three external cultivation techniques from the Dongli Sect, mostly related to the Golden Yang, had been dispersed out there. They might be useful to the rogue cultivators though."

[132] Liu Changdie, now at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, continued smiling warmly.

[136] Secretly, Liu Changdie felt a pang of disappointment.

[142] The formation at Qingdu Peak hasn't been set up yet. Now that Liu Changdie is here, we can finally get it done! Uncle Xuanfeng hasn't been back for so many years now, this is also a good opportunity to ask for his news...

[146] Liu Changdie cupped his fist and replied, "Of course! Congratulations, Brother! Senior Xuanfeng and fellow Daoist Ning Hemian have married and are now highly respected. Their reputation in the city is soaring!"

[148] As soon as Liu Changdie spoke, Li Yuanjiao was taken aback and Li Qinghong looked stunned, while Li Xuanxuan frowned. However, it was not appropriate for them to discuss anything in the presence of an outsider, so the room fell silent.

[152] Liu Changdie dared not comment anything and remained quiet. As someone who had lived two lives, even he could sense that something was amiss. With a smile, he retrieved a storage pouch and a letter from his chest pocket, explaining, "This is what Senior asked me to bring back..."

[156] The Li Family's legacies now encompassed formations, talismans, and alchemy. However, their expertise was limited to setting up formations at the Embryonic Breathing level. While they possessed numerous Qi Cultivation Realm formation diagrams, setting up one was challenging, especially when compared to Liu Changdie's proficiency. Consequently, setting up a Foundation Establishment Realm formation was far beyond their current capabilities.

[162] Liu Changdie nodded, looking slightly embarrassed, and replied, "I have made significant progress in restoring formations in Yi Mountain City over the years. If there is a formation diagram, I can give it a try, though it will be costly if I fail..."

[164] Foundation Establishment Realm formations were rare, and Liu Changdie, being an average formation master, would find setting up one a rare opportunity.

[176] Everyone fell silent. Liu Changdie, realizing the situation, shrank back and remained quiet.

[180] Liu Changdie nodded quickly and said, "I will check the earth vein and spiritual energy distribution in the mountains and set up the formation in a few days."

[182] Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement. He exchanged a few more words with Liu Changdie, and then watched him leave.

[186] As soon as Liu Changdie departed, Li Xuanxuan looked uneasy as he wondered aloud, "What is Yuan Su plotting against our family...?"

[190] Li Yuanjiao took out the letter brought back by Liu Changdie, decrypted it using the family's secret technique, and read it carefully.

# Chapter 460: Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique

[3] Liu Changdie had long been immersed in the art of formations. Despite only performing two rounds of assessments, he could clearly discern the distribution of the earth veins. His eyes shone with a perceptive light, revealing his clarity and insight.

[7] Liu Changdie possessed a wealth of formation skills that allowed him to earn plenty of Spirit Stones with them. Even without a family to support him, he traveled across the state, searching for spirit water, and it took just over a decade for him to master this perception technique.

[9] After a thorough study, Liu Changdie chose the Green Ox River Embrace Formation, a recent addition to his repertoire. This formation, which he developed in Linghai Prefecture, harnessed the power of the lake water around Mount Qingdu, combining it with the earth and water veins to repel enemies.

[17] "Brother Changdie, you're too generous!" Li Yuanjiao said, frowning. If the cost were truly fixed at a hundred Spirit Stones, his family would owe Liu Changdie a favor. So, he insisted on giving Liu Changdie 115 Spirit Stones which Liu reluctantly accepted.

[19] Liu Changdie stayed for several months while the formation was set up on Mount Qingdu. Kong Yu had mentioned that small peaks would emerge near Qingdu Mountain over the next few years, so Li Yuanjiao made sure the formation's coverage was huge enough to accommodate those peaks as well.

[21] After a drink to celebrate the project's completion, Liu Changdie stayed for another half a month before heading north to the Yue Cultivating Sect's territory to continue his study on formations and seek breakthroughs.

[23] Despite Lu Changdie's eagerness to remain with the Li Family as a guest cultivator, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to let him stay permanently due to the mysteries surrounding him. Handling the situation diplomatically, Li Yuanjiao, along with Li Qinghong, escorted Liu Changdie out of their territory.

[25] Liu Changdie, reluctant to leave, bade his goodbyes to Li Yuanjiao though he was sighing inwardly.

# Chapter 529: Zongquan Island

[9] It seemed like Mutuo had failed to deduce Brother Jiao's strength! The Li Family is certainly impressive... Did Xiao Chuting secretly involve himself in this, or was it another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind this? Li Yuanjiao's fate remains a mystery; I wonder if he's like Liu Changdie and Tu Longjian...

# Chapter 553: Crossing Lake Xian

[33] The Southern Border was often cut off from outside news. Li Xuanfeng, though he had received one update from home through Liu Changdie, knew little overall. Most of his information came through Ning Family channels.

# Chapter 641: Brother Jiao

[108] Li Qinghong was about to speak when the formation outside lit up again, and a hoarse voice called out, "Liu Changdie... requests an audience!"

[112] The two sisters headed toward the tomb. Outside the formation, Liu Changdie was greeted personally by Li Xuanxuan. Liu Changdie looked distraught, standing dazed in the rain, his face full of disbelief.

[114] Li Xuanxuan called to him several times, noting that Liu Changdie's cultivation had surprisingly reached the Foundation Establishment Realm—an impressive feat. But Liu Changdie remained motionless, and after several breaths, he finally stammered, "Senior, please do not deceive me. Is Yuanjiao really dead, or is he faking it?"

[118] Liu Changdie's heart felt like it was collapsing under a landslide. Hot tears streamed down his face as he muttered, grief-stricken and disoriented, "How could this be..."

[122] How could this happen! Liu Changdie staggered forward, unable to hear Li Xuanxuan's words beside him. His thoughts were a storm of contradictions, Is this better or worse? Yes, the Li Family has prospered, but Brother Jiao entered a grotto heaven only to lose his life. I... I've disrupted everything. I caused his death!

[126] And in all his efforts, he had lost the closest friend of his past life, even feeling responsible for his demise. Liu Changdie's head swam, and he fell to his knees before the gravestone, weeping softly.

[128] The Li Family members present couldn't understand his profound sorrow and exchanged puzzled glances. Liu Changdie's grief was so raw and heartfelt that even Li Xuanxuan began to suspect, Could it be... that Yuanjiao and this man were truly close in life?

[130] Liu Changdie, consumed by grief, was also overcome with a creeping dread. In his past life, he had been naive and ignorant, always relying on this old friend's guidance. Yuanjiao had always arranged his affairs flawlessly, and Liu Changdie owed him countless unrepaid kindnesses.

[132] Now, with foreknowledge and the advantage of rebirth, Liu Changdie had never sought Yuanjiao's advice, never spoken to him at length. Yet Yuanjiao had still met a premature death. As the years wore on, the advantages of his rebirth diminished, and the weight of his ignorance in his previous life became clearer. His regret grew heavier with every passing moment.

[134] He cried for a long time, until even Li Xuanxuan, unable to bear it, stepped forward to comfort him. Liu Changdie finally stood, his face streaked with tears, and choked out, "Brother Jiao!"

# Chapter 647: Rainbow Pierce Skyway

[49] Li Qinghong had taken one hundred spirit stones when she left and returned three. With the five types of spirit water now gathered, Li Xuanxuan hurried to summon Liu Changdie.

[51] For the past few days, Liu Changdie had been surveying Mount Qingdu, analyzing the flow of the earth's veins and spiritual energy. He had initially thought it would take months, if not years, to gather the materials. Seeing how quickly the Li Family had secured the five types of spirit water, he was slightly surprised.

[55] Liu Changdie beamed with excitement and remarked, "This is quite the collection! You are only missing a Pit Water for the Five Virtues to be complete."

[59] From his robe, Liu Changdie took out a jade bottle and said softly, "While traveling to train and cultivate the Spirit Eye Perception, which I acquired from your clan, I collected some Pure Essence Spirit Water. There are still two portions left, and this water belongs to the Pit Water system."

[63] Liu Changdie simply smiled without comment. He had previously traveled to the Eastern Sea, where he discovered a grotto heaven from his prior life and obtained a wealth of spirit resources. His storage pouch already contained various spirit waters covering the Five Virtues, which was why he had initially proposed the formation.

[67] Li Xuanxuan readily agreed, walking alongside Liu Changdie. Grasping his sleeve, he asked, "Master, that remaining portion of Pure Essence Spirit Water—does it still serve any purpose for you?"

[69] Clearly, Li Xuanxuan wanted to purchase it for the younger generation of the Li Family to practice the Spirit Eye Perception. Liu Changdie understood immediately and chuckled, "If your clan desires it, I will gladly part with it."

[71] Li Xuanxuan politely refused to take it freely, and the two descended the mountain while engaged in lively conversation. Though Liu Changdie had never met Li Xuanxuan in his previous life, he had become acquainted with him during his youth in this lifetime. Their shared stories about the past created a pleasant camaraderie.

# Chapter 660: Rumors On Green Pine Island

[31] He had only visited a restaurant twice in his lifetime. The first time had been with Liu Changdie. On that occasion, Liu Changdie had merely asked him some trivial questions and commented that his ways resembled those of the demonic path. He had mentioned Jiang Yan from the devil plague incident very early on, which suggested that he had known the inside story long before others.

# Chapter 763: Sword Cry

[49] Li Xijun had invited him to fight at the lake with a plan in mind. Liu Changdie’s Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters had been prepared long ago but had never been activated. He had saved for this moment to destroy Yu Mujian in one blow. His hands cycled rapidly through seals: Serpent Stream, Pure Essence, Grounded.

# Chapter 902: Western Shore

[74] Li Xijun answered, "We sent people to search for Senior Liu Changdie. We checked several locations but still haven’t found him. Even the boys guarding his cave dwelling haven’t seen him. It’ll take time to track him down.

# Chapter 903: Raging Thunder Quelled by Earth

[103] Even among the great sects, formation masters rarely excelled in their cultivation realm. Not everyone could be like Wan Huaqian or Liu Changdie. Li Xijun didn’t belittle them for their realm and asked, "Have the masters already seen the formation?"

# Chapter 905: Realization In Hindsight

[27] "Leaving cost aside, with Elder Liu Changdie absent and no reliable master of our own, we don’t even have the opportunity to set up the formation!"

[31] The Li Family had seen such cases many times before. The Yu Family’s market had been breached by Jiang Heqian, and outsiders came and went freely through the Fei Family’s grand formation. These were all cautionary tales. The only person they could truly trust, Liu Changdie, had gone missing. This was undoubtedly a thorny matter.

# Chapter 676: Kongheng's Story

[45] The formation was Liu Changdie's masterpiece, but its core aspects, 'Morning Mist' and 'Serpent Flow,' were designed to handle Qi Refinement cultivators. Against the Dharma Body of a Merciful One, they were utterly useless. Undeterred, Li Ximing watched with a cold expression, his hand seal abruptly changing.

# Chapter 850: Supreme Yang's Transmuting Radiance

[37] This was a remnant of the divinatory power he had obtained from Liu Changdie long ago. It was an extension of the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination, a technique that had served him well in his early years. After using most of it, he had kept this thumb-sized piece for reference.

[43] "It must be like the Immortal Dao Wall, hidden away in some grotto-heaven or secret realm. That would explain why Liu Changdie came into contact with the talisman but left no trail. He must have accidentally stumbled upon the entrance to that hidden domain…"

# Chapter 928, Yuanbian

[186] This person was Liu Changdie!

[192] He had heard that this man and his uncle, Li Yuanjiao, were inseparable friends. Back then, Liu Changdie had wept so hard at his uncle's grave that he'd cried more fiercely than most of the relatives…

[196] Therefore, among all the brothers, only Li Ximing had never met him. Liu Changdie had deeply regretted this at the time and had even asked Li Xijun about him… He never charged a single coin for his array work, due to a debt of gratitude. Thus, when Li Ximing came out of seclusion, Li Xuanxuan had specifically shown him a portrait of Liu Changdie, so he would remember the man…

[200] Although he knew this man had some peculiarities, the world was full of people with secrets. How many of them ever reached the Purple Mansion Realm! Liu Changdie had actually managed to do it in this desolate and remote place?!

[202] He understood the deep friendship between his family and Liu Changdie. He was both shocked and overjoyed. Who could have known that the emotions of the man before him were far more complex than his own…

[204] Li Ximing had never met Liu Changdie, but Liu Changdie had met _him_! In a past life, Li Ximing's concubine had been Liu Changdie's daughter! Seeing his face now, how could he not be lost in a daze! A sob caught in his throat, and in a voice choked with a mixture of grief and joy, he cried,

[212] With just this one sentence, he was almost certain that the man before him was Liu Changdie. He was momentarily at a loss, and could only sigh,

[216] Liu Changdie stared at him deeply.

[236] Liu Changdie turned his head away, sitting down as if he couldn't breathe. Li Ximing forced a smile and replied,

[250] Liu Changdie Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Array Master

# Chapter 929, Red Pheasant Surging Li

[19] His words were fitting for the occasion. Li Ximing and Liu Changdie drank together. Li Ximing offered a polite smile, but Liu Changdie was still lost in nostalgic sighs. He turned his head and said seriously,

[27] This was true. Li Ximing nodded. Liu Changdie's trustworthiness was beyond compare. He then watched as the Demon King recounted their previous plan in great detail. He grabbed Liu Changdie's hand, saying awkwardly,

[31] Liu Changdie nodded and smiled.

[39] Liu Changdie said softly,

[45] Fuxun was overjoyed. He very carefully took the stone box and passed it to Li Ximing. Liu Changdie, however, frowned with some concern and reminded them,

[53] Seeing the two of them in a bind, Li Ximing smiled, for Liu Changdie's sake. He also took a stone box from his sleeve, revealing the Surging Li Treasure Leaf. He said softly,

[57] As soon as he said this, Liu Changdie looked secretly troubled and hesitant, but Fuxun was ecstatic,

[61] Liu Changdie could only transmit his voice silently using his dharma power,

[73] Li Ximing stroked his beard. Liu Changdie smiled and explained,

[89] He was fine, but the moment Liu Changdie saw the palace, his eyes lit up, and he couldn't walk another step. He stroked his chin, tilted his head, and studied it intently.

[134] Liu Changdie, at his side, was not surprised, but Huo Yang's expression was stiff. Li Ximing, who had been observing her as a Li Fire cultivator, immediately spoke up,

[202] At this moment, all three were stunned. Fuxun and Huo Yang were each happy for their own reasons. Even Liu Changdie stroked his beard and sighed to himself,

[232] Liu Changdie Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Array Master

# Chapter 930: The Harmonising and Vault Lock

[13] He stared at the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, unable to tear his eyes away. Spiritual flames were treasures coveted by all, and the Demon beast and Liu Changdie next to him immediately cast envious glances.

[15] The pill had yet to be refined, so the Li Fire should have been in Fuxun's care. However, due to Liu Changdie's presence, Fuxun didn't step forward to receive the flame. He hesitated in place, making no move, clearly showing respect and intending to let Li Ximing take it directly.

[31] Li Ximing pondered this, nodding with great interest. The nearby Liu Changdie also seemed to gain some insight. After explaining the benefits, Huo Yang looked slightly awkward, continuing,

[65] With Li Ximing having already obtained the spiritual flame, Fuxun would have feared he would turn and run if it weren't for the reassurance of Liu Changdie. At the moment, he had no mind to say more. He nodded silently, indicating he had accepted the task, and said no more.

[77] When they arrived at the Great Void, Liu Changdie immediately offered his congratulations. Li Ximing was also overjoyed to have the spiritual flame in his possession, so much so that he was a little absent-minded. For one, he wanted to test the power and marvel of the Li Fire. For another, he wanted to begin cultivating the Great Parting's White Brilliance.

[89] When talk turned to returning to Jiangnan, Liu Changdie's expression clearly soured. He fell silent, and it took him a while to reply.

[95] Liu Changdie clasped his hands behind his back and said quietly:

[113] Liu Changdie remained silent for a long time, then said with a note of melancholy:

[117] This had long been a question for Li Ximing. Most dao, once seen, are hard to hide. A slight display of power would be noticed by others. But Liu Changdie's aura had been contained from beginning to end, his divine ability never revealed. It was impossible to tell what it was!

[119] Seeing Li Ximing shake his head, Liu Changdie raised his hand and revealed his palm. A single silver orb of light was dancing within it, constantly switching and leaping between square and circular forms, radiating a profound and mystical aura.

[125] Liu Changdie's expression was complex. He said in a low voice:

[151] The words Harmonising Metal coming from Li Ximing's mouth were clearly unexpected for Liu Changdie. He was slightly stunned, then shook his head with a sigh.

[161] Liu Changdie nodded, saying wistfully:

[169] Liu Changdie sighed.

[183] Indeed, even a good-natured person like Liu Changdie could not help but speak in a cold voice now.

[195] While they spoke, the group had already returned to the Xipo Kingdom and sat in the previous pavilion. The night had already fallen. The brilliant five-hued light shone brightly all around. Fuxun poured wine for Liu Changdie, who drank it in a single gulp, and said in a low voice:

[213] Liu Changdie truly had a great fortune. Now, he regarded both Li Ximing and Fuxun as his closest companions, so he spilled all these secrets in one go. Both Li Ximing and Fuxun were too shocked to speak for a time.

[215] It was not until Liu Changdie had drunk several cups of wine and the jug was empty that Fuxun finally sighed.

[219] With this burden off his chest, Liu Changdie slowly relaxed, laughing at himself.

[225] Li Ximing could only console him in a low voice, sighing inwardly for him. He knew that Liu Changdie would never return to Jiangnan now. He also abandoned the thought of asking him to take a look at the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Instead, he simply said,

[229] Fuxun was naturally full of anticipation. He escorted Li Ximing out of the Xipo Kingdom and then returned with the wind, seeing Liu Changdie still drinking in the pavilion. He could not help but sigh,

[233] Liu Changdie just shook his head silently. Now that Li Ximing was gone, he could finally let his emotions show. His eyes were filled with loss and unease.

# Chapter 931, Great Parting's Radiance

[139] Li Ximing had considered this long ago. According to his original judgment, Fuxun would never allow him to take these two extremely valuable spiritual artifacts away and into another Immortal Daoist tradition. He should have asked to borrow the Purple Mansion Spiritual Cauldron instead, but now with Liu Changdie, the trust between the two sides had greatly increased. It was no problem to bring the items here. He smiled and replied,

# Chapter 932: The Halberd

[155] Li Que'wan understood they were making long-term plans and quickly took her leave. Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before speaking in a low voice. "I want to establish a department in the Deer Weeds island region. It suddenly made me think of Liu Changdie... He said his divine ability could nurture Golden Essence and resources. If he truly has the heart for it now, we could ask him to look at the Feather Transformation Pool in the cave and see if he has any ideas."

[157] Liu Changdie had a long-standing friendship with their family and was trustworthy. Unfortunately, he also carried a great deal of trouble, and Li Ximing worried about attracting unwanted attention. He looked conflicted. Deciding to table that thought, he first asked about the Water Mansion Dao, turning back to Li Zhouwei.

# Chapter 933: The Pawn

[137] Even with Liu Changdie's guarantee, the fact that Li Ximing had already taken the Li Fire was a source of anxiety. Now, Fuxun rushed over, wreathed in joyous relief. Li Ximing kept it brief, stating he was there for the spiritual items as arranged.

[143] Fuxun looked awkward and glanced at Liu Changdie, clearly hoping he would offer to go to Tiger's Frontier as well. Liu Changdie, however, was perfectly relaxed. "Then let's set off," he smiled. "There's been a lot of trouble lately, and I need to go to Fenkuai anyway. That Vermilion Bird is stirring up trouble again. Since you've made a promise to Huo Yang, Daoist Friend Fuxun, you shouldn't leave the Xipo Kingdom. We two will go, make good time, and wait for Daoist Friend Qingyan in Fenkuai."

[155] The two bid farewell to the Demon King and departed the Xipo Kingdom, riding the winds through the Great Void. Liu Changdie's mood had long since stabilized, and he began to ask curiously about Li Ximing's descendants.

[159] Liu Changdie nodded. "Before the Harmonising-Vault Union, Vault Metal is a receptive metal. Aside from a few Water and Fire virtues it clashes with, it is compatible with most. As for various waters, besides Yin-Conjunction Clear Water, most waters benefit greatly from 'Vault Metal'."

[163] Li Ximing calculated that Water Mansion would also benefit, which set his mind at ease. Liu Changdie chuckled. "Is there some treasure you'd like me to see?"

[165] Li Ximing smiled but said nothing. Liu Changdie understood that without a privacy formation, it was not the place to talk. The two continued their journey, parting ways at Linhai. Li Ximing sped directly to Tiger's Frontier. When he landed and inquired, he found that Houfu was indeed absent, but had left instructions: if Li Ximing arrived, he was to be given direct access to Kuidu Palace for his alchemy.

# Chapter 937: Marvelous Wisdom Whisker

[103] He then checked the jade pendant Liu Changdie had given him. It had activated three or five days ago and was still glowing faintly. Clearly, his contact had already been found. He couldn't delay any longer.

[125] He descended into the pavilion. Liu Changdie was sitting cross-legged, his aura fluctuating unstably. It seemed he had just been in a fight or had recently used a powerful divine ability. Seeing Li Ximing arrive, he immediately opened his eyes and smiled.

[131] Liu Changdie waved his hand to show it was nothing. He stretched out his hand and pointed to the desk, where a dark metal box sat. He smiled.

[135] Li Ximing naturally remembered the conversation and knew Liu Changdie wasn't one for empty words, but he was surprised it had happened so quickly. He tried to refuse once or twice, but Liu Changdie brushed off his protests. Left with no choice, Li Ximing smiled, offered his thanks, and stepped forward to open the box.

[141] "This is a Marvelous Wisdom Whisker," Liu Changdie explained. "It's a resource for the Gathering Wood Dao. It grows on Little Mountain of Vast Jade in the Western Sea. The moment it senses the ground, it burrows and becomes impossible to find... It must be contained using the Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual object, Heart-Locking Cloud, and further secured with formations. Otherwise, it will escape at the slightest lapse in attention. A friend of mine found a few on the mountain long ago and gave me one as a resource. Now, I am passing it to you, Daoist Friend."

[147] But Liu Changdie quickly changed the subject. "The Western Sea is, after all, extremely remote. It's the domain of the ancient master of the Water Mansion. It's impossible to cross without powerful divine abilities, and even if you reach the Abyss of the Water Mansion, it remains incredibly inconvenient. Very few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators bother to journey there. So, while this item may not be priceless, it is exceedingly rare."

[151] In truth, a niche item like the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker couldn't possibly compare to a spiritual material from the ascendant Li Fire Dao. The Surging Li Treasure Leaf had countless uses for him. But sacrifices had to be made to obtain Li Fire, and a single leaf was nothing. It was only due to Liu Changdie's integrity that he even spoke of compensation. How could Li Ximing possibly object?

[155] "Daoist Friend Qingyan has been searching for spiritual materials in this area for several days now," Liu Changdie said. "I'll go call him back..."

# Chapter 938: Profound Illumination's Doubts

[11] The moment Liu Changdie saw him, his expression turned serious and respectful.

[33] Li Ximing had heard of Daoist Master Yangya. He was a Daoist Master from the Cui family who had moved to the Western Sea and had since lost most contact with the main branch. Liu Changdie poured him some tea and smiled.

[37] At this, Qingyan let out two short laughs, pinching the tiny teacup in his massive hand. Liu Changdie immediately turned back to Li Ximing, grinning.

[41] Li Ximing was speechless. Liu Changdie continued playfully, "That was a fatal problem! It scared him half to death, and he fled overnight. But the tribesmen below were clueless; you couldn't teach them. In the end, he had no choice but to accept a few princes from the local kingdoms, have them cultivate in his palace, and then send them back to educate their people. What a fiasco! I heard it caused such a stir that... cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition even went to question him."

[45] Liu Changdie hadn't been in the Purple Mansion Realm for long, and most of this gossip was secondhand. He could only look toward Qingyan. The burly man put down his cup with some stiffness, stroked his beard, and said, "It was Yuanwu."

[49] Both Liu Changdie and Li Ximing had a moment of realization. Liu Changdie even laughed.

[53] Li Ximing nodded silently. After these few sentences, they were familiar enough. Liu Changdie got to the point.

[71] Liu Changdie listened silently and then spoke in a low voice.

[79] Qingyan said no more, slowly nodding. He and Li Ximing went out together. Liu Changdie escorted them to the nearby sea, handed an item to Qingyan, and bade them farewell.

[181] Tianque frowned. "Of course I remember... I was right there... Hasn't this already been settled by all parties? It was Liu Changdie! That lucky bastard received a calling from the Great Void. You could say he was blessed by fate."

# Chapter 948, Sun-Worshipping Mountain

[55] The moment Liu Changdie saw the Demon King Qingyan's expression, he understood. But then he noticed Li Ximing still looked troubled, which confused him. He asked cautiously, only to see Li Ximing force a smile.

[59] A heavy stone lifted from Liu Changdie's heart. If the refinement had failed, he truly wouldn't have known how to face Fuxun. Not only would his own conscience have bothered him, but it would have created a deep awkwardness between Fuxun and Li Ximing.

[61] As Liu Changdie relaxed, Li Ximing also adjusted his mindset.

[69] After all, he had obtained his Li Fire and refined the necessary pill. There was no need to travel thousands of miles to Poluoduo. He took out the jade vial, sealed with a divine ability, and handed it to Liu Changdie, saying gravely,

[73] Liu Changdie had already noticed his expression was off. Although he felt it would be better for Li Ximing to be present to personally receive the thanks for such a favor, he didn't press the issue. He sighed and replied,

[81] Liu Changdie stroked his beard and laughed.

[85] Liu Changdie was genuinely kind. Of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators Li Ximing knew, not one had ever offered to help him and then waited patiently. Li Ximing was deeply moved.

[89] Liu Changdie shook his head with a smile and, together with Qingyan, strode into the Great Void. Li Ximing rode his light, speeding all the way, and soon arrived in Wu State.

[191] He produced an item in his hand. Inside a box, layers of flowing clouds concealed a faint, yellowish-white light. It was the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker gifted by Liu Changdie!

[199] These Purple Mansion Realm figures all had deep knowledge of their own Dao Lineage's origins. He had hit the nail on the head. Li Ximing was unwilling to mention Liu Changdie, so he just said, "I acquired it by chance. Can you use it, Daoist friend?"

# Chapter 949: A Debt of Gratitude

[17] Li Ximing assumed his "instability" referred to the conflict between the North and South. He offered a few polite words, silently filing away the arrangement, and then bid Dingyang Zi farewell. Calculating the time, he figured Liu Changdie was likely still in Poluoduo, so he summoned the wind and flew north.

# Chapter 951: Perilous Tread

[15] Liu Changdie's face was filled with astonishment. He had clearly sensed the wondrous nature of the array. He stroked his beard, his eyes flashing with surprise, too astonished for words. He only said, "What a treasure! A true work of heaven-defying creation!"

[25] Liu Changdie's perception was extremely sharp. Almost in sync with him, his gaze fell upon the Feather Transformation Pool in the center of the hall. He strode forward, leaned down, and stared intently at the pristine white dharma pool, shaken beyond words.

[29] Li Ximing was the sole master of the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, so it moved like an extension of his own limbs. With a mere thought, his spiritual sense connected to the array and instantly recorded Liu Changdie's aura.

[31] The moment Liu Changdie connected to the array, he pressed his hands to the pool's edge without hesitation. Streaks of silver light immediately began to flow around the water, accompanied by the clinking and clanking of chains.

[41] Li Ximing used a divine ability to retrieve it, placing it in a box with satisfaction. Liu Changdie, however, remained focused. He gently brushed the white jade at the bottom of the pool. The surface swiftly turned transparent, revealing countless runes embedded within.

[47] Liu Changdie looked up, his eyes blazing. "Ximing, if you dismantle the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, you will definitely be rewarded!"

[51] Li Ximing put on an awkward expression of sudden realization. Liu Changdie, however, waved his hands, answering his own question. "No, it cannot be dismantled! It mustn't! Such a precious technique from a senior... it must be studied properly!"

[59] Thus, he wasted no time and made an excuse to leave. Liu Changdie, however, stood up abruptly, looking hurried. "Let's go out together. It's inconvenient for me on the island. Ximing, why don't you assign someone to run errands for me."

[71] Li Ximing felt a sense of warmth seeing him. As they flew toward the center of the island, he asked about his recent life. Liu Changdie, however, wore a complex expression. He suddenly asked, "That An Zheyan... how is he now?"

[75] "Oh!" Liu Changdie replied. He adjusted his robes, his expression complicated, and asked, "Where is the old man? I shall go and see him!"

[77] Liu Changdie knew An Zheyan. When he had been constructing the array for the Li family, the old man had been his liaison. Not only that, they had known each other in a past life... The first fortune he ever made... was from taking a spirit herb from Lixia Prefecture that An Zheyan was meant to discover in his prime.

[83] Li Ximing also felt a pang of sympathy. Since Liu Changdie wished it, he nodded his assent. The three descended and soon found the man in a courtyard.

[95] As Li Ximing stood silently, Liu Changdie's eyes reddened. He stood frozen in place. "Old Man An... Old Man An..."

[113] Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He was about to step forward and use a divine ability to keep him coherent a little longer, but Liu Changdie cried out, "Just let him go..."

[121] Liu Changdie couldn't bear to look. He turned his head away, retrieved a jade box from his sleeve, and placed it beside An Siwei. He hurried out of the courtyard. He and Li Ximing walked for some time before he lowered his head and said wretchedly, "He should be sent back to Mount Yuting for burial."

# Chapter 959, Merit

[173] "And that's not all! Senior Liu Changdie has been in the Eastern Sea for over a year now. With his help, the Neck Feathers have likely already been condensed. You just focus on your cultivation. I will handle all of these matters!"

# Chapter 966: Arrangements for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion

[109] Li Ximing smiled. "My original guess was correct. That cave-mansion is a real treasure trove. Three more have condensed since then, and adding the one that took a full year to form before Senior Liu Changdie arrived, I had four in hand. Now, having traded one for the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves, there are still three left."

# Chapter 967, People from the Past

[15] Liu Changdie looked up, the radiance of his divine ability gradually dimming. He replied,

[25] Liu Changdie's expression grew solemn. He replied,

[29] He gently turned his hand, and clusters of light fell into his sleeve. Liu Changdie said seriously,

[49] Liu Changdie shook his head.

[57] Liu Changdie shook his head and smiled,

[71] Liu Changdie took the opportunity to explain,

[83] As this scene materialized, Li Ximing frowned, his expression filled with shock and uncertainty. Liu Changdie was clearly just as surprised. He shot to his feet and exclaimed,

[113] While Li Ximing was lost in thought, Liu Changdie was staring intently at the endless vortex of small flags. He scanned them one by one, his astonishment growing, and asked,

[117] Li Ximing glanced over, slightly puzzled, but Liu Changdie said in a heavy tone,

[129] The Wan family had once been neighbors with the Li Clan; they were, in fact, the first family the Li Clan had encountered. Li Ximing had naturally heard of them. At his words, Liu Changdie nodded hesitantly and sat back down, his expression grim.

[137] Liu Changdie's gaze grew heavy as countless thoughts raced through his mind. Suddenly, he asked,

[147] As soon as he said this, Liu Changdie knew he was well-informed. He sighed.

[151] Liu Changdie pinched his fingers, making a quick calculation. His smile grew stiff as he muttered,

[161] Liu Changdie laughed coldly, as if some old rumor had just been confirmed.

[167] Li Ximing frowned to himself, listening as Liu Changdie's eyes grew sharp.

[173] Liu Changdie clearly held a deep loathing for the great powers of Jiangnan and Jiangbei, always assuming the most sinister motives. Li Ximing was more moderate. He felt that while Liu's analysis wasn't entirely objective, it was mostly logical. He could only sigh.

[177] Liu Changdie merely waved his hand dismissively, his gaze fixed on the Spiritual Artifact at the base of the array.

[185] Liu Changdie stared intently at the array, thinking for a long time before replying,

# Chapter 973: I Command the Laws of Heaven

[234] This was the source of Liu Changdie's delusions of reincarnation, the very same Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination that had aided him countless times in his early cultivation! The object he had sought for so long was finally here. It truly was inside Wanling Heaven!

# Chapter 974: Rank Designation

[13] This was the very thing the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had sensed and released all those years ago. Its wondrous aspect had attached itself to Liu Changdie. Later, when it came within range of the Immortal Mirror, Lu Jiangxian had retrieved it from Liu Changdie due to the Talisman Qi resonance. He had used it several times, leaving only this tiny speck behind.

[19] Liu Changdie.

[21] However, the Liu Changdie in the vision was pale, his aura weak, and his cultivation low. This was the Liu Changdie the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had foreseen years ago. As Lu Jiangxian poured in a stream of dharma power and Talisman Qi, time itself flowed backward, and the scenes began to reverse.

[39] 'This wondrous aspect drifted aimlessly until it landed on Liu Changdie. It divined his future for him. When I stumbled upon it, its power wasn't depleted; it still held several divinations. Its ultimate goal was to guide Liu Changdie, step by step, to advance his cultivation, unveil Wanling Heaven, and release the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination!'

# Chapter 992: The Matter of Cultivation

[77] 'But these True Monarchs know full well that the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book cannot truly be suppressed. Even with Wanling Heaven acting as an outer cage and the Lingyang Immutable Palace as an inner one, Liu Changdie still emerged...'

[81] "In truth, it wasn't just Liu Changdie. There were others like him. The master of Wanling Heaven's ultimate contingency was the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. Besides the part where I interfered, there must have been other failsafes. The moment Wanling Heaven was breached, a man named Lin Hengjiang answered the call of the book and the 'Heaven–Governing' Fruition Attainment, spontaneously awakening his Shengyang Acupoint... Not to mention the several streaks of silver light that erupted from various locations and fell upon the world."

[117] Li Xizhi cultivated for many years before suddenly perishing. Li Zhouming died of illness thirteen years later. Xia Shouyu led the clan for seventy-nine years, until the day Liu Changdie and Fuxun were killed by the White Victory Palace. Then, the entire clan was exterminated.

[139] The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was not like the minor divination power Liu Changdie possessed. Even bound by Dharma Treasures, it still possessed the noble status and profound mystery of a 'Rank Designation'. It might not be able to calculate the future actions of a True Monarch, but 80 to 90 percent of the past and present schemes of all the great powers were well within its calculations!

[159] 'He made all those arrangements, even going so far as to erase his own memories to become the me I am today. There must have been a reason. If the Li family was doomed to perish while I remained safe, why would he have set up Liu Changdie? Why would he have arranged for me to see these 1,891 futures?'

[197] 'I cannot personally intervene in every matter. But the Li Clan needs its own Liu Changdie. It needs a member of the Li family who believes they understand the future, someone at the very center of the storm who sees it all clearly... someone to place the pieces on the board for me, one by one...'

# Chapter 997: Changes

[27] However, Li Ximing had already sorted out his cultivation manuals and summoned Li Jiangchun for a long talk. He had left the mountain long ago, flying toward the Eastern Sea to trade for a Dao Lineage with Liu Changdie, and to visit Li Que'wan while he was there.

# Chapter 1003: Harmony and Accord

[7] He had seen quite a few "Sacred Scrolls" in the Li family's possession. The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity, the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court, and even the Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession that Liu Changdie had mentioned in passing—they were all of the same category.

# Chapter 1016: The Two Rites

[175] And he himself had a 'Attaining Brightness' from the 'Upper Rite' that his grand-uncle had obtained from Daoist Master Yuanbian. The Qi-gathering method used Daoist Master Yuanbian's spiritual object, the 'Luminous-Empyrean Scroll-Cloud'. Naturally, this spiritual object would not be given to him. Liu Changdie had not specifically gone to collect it, but had it collected by his own people in the Qunyi Archipelago and then sent to him.

# Chapter 1017: The Sima Family

[27] The place was proving to be quite troublesome. Liu Changdie was unwilling to come to the mainland, making it difficult to find someone to handle this. Si Yuanli’s willingness to put in the effort saved Li Zhouwei considerable time. As Li Zhouwei took a seat to the side, Li Minggong strode in.

# Chapter 1018: Countermeasures

[119] "As for the Qunyi Archipelago... its preservation is thanks to Liu Changdie."

[127] Wei Xuanyin's expression turned serious. "Do not underestimate Changxiao. He also factored in the variable of Liu Changdie. Whether through secret scheming or a direct agreement with the White Victory Dao, his timing was impeccable. At that moment, trouble was brewing in the Western Sea. If Liu Changdie had been forced to move, the Qunyi Archipelago would not have been saved either."

# Chapter 1027: Nanwu

[159] Even his trade with the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and his meeting with the person on Yinzhou Island were things he should have handled personally. But with numerous threats looming and Moongaze Lake needing protection, he couldn't leave in a timely manner. He finally had Liu Changdie, but he had to be stationed at the Qunyi Archipelago! These tasks had piled up for so long that Li Zhouwei had been forced to act as an errand boy on his last trip out.

# Chapter 1054: Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body

[119] This man was Daoist Master Yuanbian, Liu Changdie.

[121] Liu Changdie appeared very composed. He had spent little time in seclusion these past years, choosing instead to guard this island. He used to venture out occasionally, but after that one stormy night, he had not taken a single step off the island.

[125] The thunderstorm that night had been highly unnatural, clearly directed by someone. Liu Changdie had suppressed his impulse to investigate. Afterward, he secretly performed divinations and, combining them with the subtleties of his own divine ability, managed to uncover several clues.

[129] There was a reason Liu Changdie spent most of his years in the Southern Sea and the Eastern Sea. Many of the treasures he possessed were 'fated opportunities' he had stumbled upon in these waters. He had long suspected that the Dragon-kin had a vested interest in protecting him. This incident had confirmed all his prior suspicions.

[133] Seeing Li Que'wan, Liu Changdie seemed pleased. He nodded at her and rose with a smile.

[137] When Liu Changdie first arrived on the island, he received instructions from Li Ximing to protect Li Que'wan at all costs. He had kept this in mind, and after a private conversation with her, he was utterly stunned by her heavenly talent. The depth of her Dao-Profundity and the clarity of her thinking when casting spell arts were not at all like those of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

[151] For this reason, Liu Changdie held this junior from the Li clan in extremely high regard. He could already see her future path to the Purple Mansion Realm and had begun to treat her as a peer.

[159] As Li Que'wan examined it, Liu Changdie explained with a smile, “This scroll was sent by your family. They obtained it from some place called the Changxiao Gate. It’s an ancient artifact, locked with a secret preservation technique. They asked me to decipher it… It took quite some effort.”

[169] Such an item might not have been extraordinary in ancient times, but today, when methods for reincarnation and Great Void-walking were mostly lost, it was invaluable. Liu Changdie nodded in agreement.

[183] Liu Changdie shook his head and laughed. He had long since stopped considering his time a precious commodity. He took a letter from his sleeve and said,

[187] Li Que'wan received it like a treasure and began to read. Liu Changdie watched her profile and sighed inwardly.

[191] As Liu Changdie was lost in thought, a figure hurried into the grotto. The man bowed before him and reported respectfully,

[197] Liu Changdie’s first thought was of the Dragon-kin, and his heart leaped in alarm. But then, he felt a sudden resonance and took a golden jade pendant from his sleeve. A closer look brought a flash of understanding and a hint of embarrassment.

[205] - Liu Changdie [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]

# Chapter 1055: Possession

[3] Liu Changdie rolled up the scroll in his hands and dismissed Li Que'wan. He then hurried to the edge of the great formation, where he saw a lone figure standing above the churning sea. The man’s eyes were a startling mix of white and red. He was clad in bone armor and blood-red silks, a pair of golden wings folded neatly behind him as he stood in silence.

[5] Seeing his faint and listless aura, Liu Changdie was filled with sorrow. He quickly opened a path in the formation and gestured for the man to enter. The Demon King strode in with his hands behind his back, staggering like a lost soul.

[9] Liu Changdie sighed. As he led the man inside, he retrieved a vial of spirit pills from his sleeve.

[13] Fuxun took the jade vial, uncorked it, and, to Liu Changdie’s pained expression, poured the pills into his cavernous mouth as if they were candy. The demon beast didn't seem to taste them at all. He smacked his lips, his red eyes fixed on Liu Changdie.

[17] Li Ximing had indeed refined and left behind pills for him when he came for the cultivation art, but Liu Changdie was exceptionally frugal. He shook his head and sighed.

[21] Others might not have known, but Liu Changdie had been the one to handle every single transaction for the Neck Feathers. He even knew that the supply of Wall-Sinking Water from the Eastern Sea had dried up long ago, halting production entirely. Liu Changdie knew exactly how luxurious Li Ximing’s cultivation was. Even with his own considerable wealth, he could only admit his own inferiority.

[27] Liu Changdie frowned. He watched as the demon beast lifted his robes, revealing three massive holes in his otherwise flawless, jade-like Dharma Body. But inside the wounds, there was no bone or flesh. Instead, they looked like a rich man's cellar; golden sand cascaded like a waterfall, with gold tables and chairs scattered about. Emeralds and rubies the size of fingernails dotted the scene, where one or two lavishly dressed, thumb-sized lesser demons knelt in the sand, weeping.

[29] Liu Changdie stared, stunned for a moment.

[37] Liu Changdie was momentarily speechless. He didn't believe for a second that Fuxun was particularly benevolent toward his so-called subordinates. They were there for two reasons: one, to run errands, serve him, and help him cultivate his Dharma Body; and two, they were probably emergency rations for when his injuries became unstable.

[49] Liu Changdie had anticipated that the two demons might face a calamity, but he never imagined it would be this severe. He was horrified.

[65] A wave of guilt and unease washed over Liu Changdie. He lowered his head.

[77] Liu Changdie wasn't as close with Qingyan as he was with Fuxun, but they were well-acquainted. A storm of complex emotions churned within him, and a surge of grief rose in his heart.

[81] But just as the demon before him lowered his head, his jade-white cheek suddenly began to writhe, as if something underneath were struggling violently to break free. A grotesque, fist-sized face tore its way out. Its two eyes were hollow sockets, the flesh sunken in, and they stared blankly at Liu Changdie.

[83] Liu Changdie staggered back a step in shock.

[91] Liu Changdie’s brow was tightly furrowed. He remained silent for a long time. After his coughing subsided, Fuxun knew the other man was waiting for an explanation. He forced a smile.

[95] Seeing Liu Changdie’s tense expression, Fuxun understood and quickly shook his head.

[99] Only then did Liu Changdie feel some relief, though he was still torn between sympathy and anxiety.

[103] They looked at each other in silence. Liu Changdie sighed.

[111] Liu Changdie remained silent, shaking his head.

[125] Sensing that Fuxun had something more to say, Liu Changdie asked,

[139] Liu Changdie finally understood. He was silent for a long time.

[143] Liu Changdie knew nothing of the great powers' grand plans, but he would bet his life that the Dragon-kin had ulterior motives. Unless it was a last resort, he truly didn't want to trouble Li Ximing.

[147] But Fuxun's situation was also important. He was caught between a rock and a hard place. After a long silence, Liu Changdie finally replied,

[153] Liu Changdie silently shook his head and left. He had only taken a few steps when he saw Li Que'wan hurrying across the main hall, her face slightly pale.

[155] Liu Changdie quickly called out to her.

[165] Liu Changdie sighed inwardly.

[193] 'Liu Changdie, oh, Liu Changdie, you've invited a plague into your home!'

[215] Liu Changdie [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]

# Chapter 1058: One After Another

[53] Li Ximing had to temporarily suppress his feelings and take out the letter. He read it. Liu Changdie had written a hundred grand-sounding words explaining the situation, his tone filled with pleading. Li Ximing's expression tightened.

[97] Li Suining merely bowed, found an appropriate level of detail, and began to speak concisely. Li Ximing listened in silence, secretly committing it all to memory, preparing to discuss it in detail with Liu Changdie later.

# Chapter 1060: The Five Virtues Doctrine

[11] Hearing his transmitted thoughts, Li Que'wan worried he was blaming Liu Changdie and quickly replied, "Lord Liu has been very kind to us all these years. It's not as if he _meant_ for this to happen..."

[65] "In his letters, did Liu Changdie ever mention Fuxun seeking an audience with the Dragon-kin?"

[73] His expression was distant as he continued, "As for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, that's not difficult to resolve. Since Liu Changdie already mentioned it, your trip now has a perfect pretext. I'll write a letter at once. Grand-Uncle, you will take it to Chongzhou and give it to Huiyao. Have him ask the Sea-Patrolling Envoy to make a trip to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. That will solve the problem without our family getting too deeply involved."

# Chapter 1064: Heretical Worship of the Layered Mountains

[37] An Siwei was alarmed. He quickly sent someone ahead with detailed instructions to report to Liu Changdie, while he himself waited humbly to the side. Stealing a terrified glance, he asked with extreme caution:

[67] Liu Changdie had only heard that the Dragon-kin were visiting, but he largely understood. Li Ximing was so pressed for time he hadn't even been able to meet, rushing off with Li Que'wan. He must be desperate to secure relations with the Dragon-kin so he can hurry back to the mainland... It made Liu Changdie feel a pang of empathy.

[77] Liu Changdie led him inward. The two did not enter the cave dwelling, but instead sat in the island's courtyard. The Demon King's expression was calm as he said faintly,

[81] As those words registered, Liu Changdie realized this visit wasn't just about Fuxun. He grew vigilant, though his words remained humble.

[89] The suspicion in Liu Changdie's heart was instantly confirmed. He shot up from his seat, bowing low in a profound show of gratitude. "Yuanbian has long sensed... I am deeply indebted to this great lady..."

[95] Liu Changdie was stunned. "This... Profound Maiden...?" he asked, confused.

[101] Liu Changdie finally understood. The 'Profound Maiden' Lu Xu meant was the Valley Water Matriarch. It was true; cultivators did usually call her 'Matriarch'. A cold sweat broke out on his back. He had been rattled by the phrase 'favored by the Heaven-Governing,' which had exposed his deepest secret. He was flustered and, unable to control himself, quickly slapped his own face several times in apology. He tried to cover his panic with a question.

[111] Liu Changdie was struck by a sudden, total understanding. All his past questions seemed to answer themselves at once. A wave of sorrow washed over him, leaving him speechless. Lu Xu watched him quietly.

[115] His gaze was intense, as if trying to discern if his words had taken root. Liu Changdie sighed, tears welling in his eyes.

[123] Liu Changdie hurriedly excused himself. A moment later, the white-robed, red-eyed youth rushed into the hall and kowtowed deeply.

# Chapter 1065: Overlook

[21] The Dragon-kin had not been slow to act. When Li Ximing returned to the lake from Chongzhou two years ago, he had already received Liu Changdie's reply. The letter also mentioned that the Wave-Suppressing Mansion had been protected by the Dragon-kin back then, for which Liu Changdie was eternally grateful.

[23] The letter had given Li Ximing quite a fright. Only then did he understand that when Changxiao had hatched his plot, it was his own aunt who had intervened. But Liu Changdie hadn't fully believed the Xu Water Demon King's words, and neither did Li Ximing. He sneered internally:

[25] 'Back then, Aunt clearly said she wouldn't interfere. She wouldn't even see me when I fled to the Lie Sea. Those words must have been false. Perhaps it was for Minghuang's sake, or perhaps someone was making a move behind Liu Changdie's back. It certainly wasn't out of any personal sentiment.'

[29] Liu Changdie was truly a loyal man; he was still writing back and forth to ask about this on Fuxun's behalf. Li Ximing, naturally, played dumb. It wasn't that he was heartless—he truly didn't have the guts to get involved. He only offered Liu Changdie a tactful reminder as he picked up his brush:

[33] Liu Changdie had reached the Purple Mansion Realm all on his own; he was a smart man. A hint was all he needed. He would naturally find a way to justify his actions.

# Chapter 1067: The Alternate Body

[5] This scroll was profoundly mysterious, an artifact from ancient times. Even a cultivator like Liu Changdie, a Vault Metal cultivator with a exception dao lineage, had struggled to decipher it. The scroll itself felt soft and pliant to the touch, similar in form to the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll.

# Chapter 1077: A Change of Post

[7] Liu Changdie had been living more comfortably these days. The Xu Water Demon King, sent by the Dragon-kin, had explained their various plans. Although he still didn't dare set foot on the mainland, he could at least move about the Eastern Sea under the Dragon-kin's protection, enjoying a measure of freedom.

[9] But this wasn't what weighed on Liu Changdie's mind. His hesitation stemmed from Fuxun.

[11] After Li Ximing's warning, Liu Changdie no longer dared to seek out Fuxun casually. In all this time, today was the only visit he had made.

[15] Superficially, the injuries had healed, but the insidious damage lingered deep in his marrow, a plague clinging to his bones that he couldn't shake. Fuxun was in misery, constantly begging him to find a cultivator from the Lesser Yang Daoist Tradition to help heal him, which left Liu Changdie speechless.

[27] Liu Changdie actually knew a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Eastern Sea. He had once roamed the World's Navel and formed some connections with the Daoist Tradition there. After achieving the Purple Mansion Realm, he had returned to renew those ties.

[35] Liu Changdie's Dao-Profundity wasn't high among those in the Purple Mansion Realm, but his knowledge was first-rate. How could he not know of the 'Heaven–Governing'?

[39] Liu Changdie knew this "favor" must be related to his rebirth. He had survived to this day only on account of the Valley Water Matriarch... which meant he had no choice but to come and build this connection.

[47] Liu Changdie replied, "Senior Cang Tiaozi, it has been a long time!"

[49] The Daoist Master gave a light nod and led him inside, asking a few concerned questions about his recent situation. Liu Changdie, however, couldn't detect any special treatment. Once they were seated at the table, Cang Tiaozi stated flatly:

[53] Liu Changdie knew that this 'Cang Tiaozi' before him was merely a skin-bag cast off by a Valley Water divine ability. That it could walk and talk was already incredible; he couldn't expect it to make specific expressions. He began by inquiring about the recent happenings in the Eastern Sea.

[57] Liu Changdie was just trying to start a conversation, but he seemed to have landed right on Cang Tiaozi's worries. The man shook his head.

[63] The name Vermillion Sea (Zhu Lu) didn't just refer to the water's color. The _'Zhu Lu'_ was actually a homophone for 'Execution', referencing the fall of that Eighth Prince. Liu Changdie naturally knew this. But the two places were extremely far apart; it shouldn't have concerned this Daoist Master so much. Upon asking, he saw a pained look cross Cang Tiaozi's face.

[67] Liu Changdie never left the Eastern Sea, not even its borders, so he had no interest in this. He smiled.

[75] Liu Changdie sensed the other's guardedness. He had asked about the Valley Water Matriarch several times, but the man just smiled and brushed him off. He had no choice but to get to the point.

[83] Joy sparked in Liu Changdie.

[87] The reason Liu Changdie had asked this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the World's Navel was because this place was ancient and held many spiritual items. Furthermore, the Valley Water's healing abilities were second to none. Cang Tiaozi often received favors from others, making it highly likely he would have such things!

[91] Li Ximing had asked him about a spiritual item for Li Que'wan before. Liu Changdie didn't have one himself, but he had sighed in astonishment at the request:

[105] Liu Changdie understood immediately, though he felt a pang of disappointment.

[113] Liu Changdie wasn't surprised. A flicker of recognition crossed his face as he sighed,

[121] The Xinggong Terrace Liu Changdie mentioned had once been a great sect in the Western Sea. It had seen a glorious era; its Great Daoist Master, Miaoqi, had advanced step by step, crossing into the Purple Mystery in her later years to become one of the world's foremost figures.

[125] Liu Changdie had roamed the world, leaving tracks even in the Western Sea, and had known figures from the Xinggong Terrace. He thus felt a certain melancholy. Cang Tiaozi, far more detached, smiled.

[129] Spiritual water and fire already held value far beyond ordinary items. By using them as a comparison, Cang Tiaozi was stressing the item's worth. Liu Changdie quickly took a jade box from his sleeve and showed its contents to the Daoist Master, but Cang Tiaozi just shook his head.

[133] This put Liu Changdie in a bind. The One-Qi White Globe Stone he possessed was meant to be traded for the Guanyuan Profound Light. How could he use it now?

[141] Cang Tiaozi naturally agreed and saw him out of the mountain. Liu Changdie grabbed his hand, pleading repeatedly,

[245] Liu Changdie [Early Purple Mansion Realm]

# Chapter 1082: The Sequence

[219] What he had obtained from Liu Changdie back then was indeed titled the Great Void Revolution Art. But what had ended up in his hands was, in fact, the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence! Of course it was profound and abstruse. The numerous secret arts had all been redacted and sealed away—all of them in the hands of Li Ximing!

# Chapter 1088: A Dream

[151] Li Ximing had received word from Liu Changdie some time ago. Liu Changdie had been making inquiries for him at the World's Navel and found a Whole Pill spirit item called Vermillion Temple Golden Sand.

[153] Unfortunately, the owner, Cang Tiaozi, was driving a hard bargain. He refused to trade it for anything other than Liu Changdie's One-Qi White Globe Stone, so the deal had stalled. Li Ximing had even asked for a list of other items Cang Tiaozi might accept, but they were all things he had never even heard of. The chances seemed slim.

[165] After a moment's thought, he retrieved Liu Changdie's letter from his sleeve. He copied the list of items Cang Tiaozi wanted and handed it to Che Hong.

# Chapter 1093: Grand Divination

[235] Even if his ancestor hadn't carefully inspected Liu Changdie, Liu Changdie had been on the very same island as Fuxun. Since Li Ximing detected Fuxun back then, it's impossible he would have missed Liu Changdie!

# Chapter 1094: Origin Heart

[13] 'This matter with Li Suining and Liu Changdie being favored by the Heavenly Element... was it your backer who told you?'

[27] "As for Liu Changdie, I don't know which faction handled his case. But the situation at the time was tense. The great figures had one consensus, that is, as long as the Jade True situation was unresolved, Anhuai and Wanling could not be breached. Yet, none of them trusted each other. No one was at ease placing him in another's hands, but they couldn't eliminate him either... After all, no one knew the true situation within Wanling Heaven, and keeping him alive was useful. Thus, they pushed him into the Vault Metal."

[37] "Now, the Book of Elements has fallen into the Exiled Qi. Obscured and entangled, it can no longer influence the present world. But that wasn't the case back then. The Book of Elements was still in Wanling. How much power did it have? What was its situation? No one knew. The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could use one piece to move a hundred pieces across the world. The most critical task was to sever Liu Changdie's connection to it!"

[41] "Therefore, they needed something powerful enough to contend with the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book, something that could completely sever Liu Changdie from it without transferring the karmic consequences onto themselves."

[43] "And so, Liu Changdie was brought to Moongaze Lake. The treasure there was the only suitable one. It was suitable to a point of absolute perfection."

[57] "This item causes diviners to miscalculate and observers to fail in their observation. It is indescribably precious. Even the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could not calculate its existence, let alone through the barrier of a grotto-heaven... so it couldn't have been a deliberate plot to bring him to the lake. Nothing was more suitable. Liu Changdie made one trip to the lake, and from then on, his divinatory light vanished, and his chaotic fate was severed. Though he retained his ability to know the future, he had already fallen to a lower path. Not only was his connection to the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book broken, but even the lingering favor upon him disappeared."

[65] "That's it... That's why our divine abilities can't see the strangeness in Suining, but Liu Changdie was infamous among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators back then!"

# Chapter 1110: The Demon Body

[241] 'Back then, that Liu Changdie visited the lake once and his connection to the Book of Elements was severed by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. He went from being an anomaly only a True Monarch could sense to a beacon that drew the attention of all divine abilities... and the miracle upon him was stripped away.'

[243] That was Qingyu Qian's explanation. But as Li Zhouwei studied Li Suining, a strange feeling rose again. Wasn't Li Suining just like Liu Changdie?

# Chapter 1119 The Pear Garden

[81] Li Zhouwei frowned. He quickly connected this to Li Suining's year-long seclusion and the natural way he had just mentioned Liu Changdie. An answer formed in his mind.
